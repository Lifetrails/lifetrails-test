# Test Task: A train journey app

There is one screen:

 - Add inputs for start and end station
 - Add a button to search for the journey
 - Display the journey details

In your code, you'll have to write the UI controls, and the logic to search for the journey.

All your code should go into `TrainJourney.tsx`

## Setup
1. IDE: We recommend using VS Code. 

2. Install the basic dependencies

 - Node.js and npm

 - Local js/ts packages:
 
`npm install`

2. Get the Web version running (note it doesn't cover many features)

`npm expo`

Press (w) to run the web version.

It should open in your browser and just work. 


## Android Setup Task

This task is to get an Android version running -- _without_ Expo Go.

1. On to Android! 
   - Install Android Studio 
   - Android SDK (installed via a tool in Android Studio -- may also need an EXPORT path to be set)
   - Android Emulator (optional - plugging in a phone by usb cable is better)

2. Find the Android Debug Bridge tool ADB (or install it)

3. Start ADB with    

`sudo adb start-server`

4. Start the app

`npm run android`

Email a screenshot showing both (a) the terminal launching the app, and (b) the app running in the emulator.
